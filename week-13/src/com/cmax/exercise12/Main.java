/**
 * Created by Clint on 4/19/2016.
 * Implement a Queue<E> generic type similar to the Stack<E> type but
 * with enqueue() and dequeue() methods. The enqueue() method adds an
 * element to the queue and the dequeue() method removes the first/oldest
 * element from the queue. Stacks are often described as being "last-in,
 * first-out" whereas queues represent a "first-in, first-out" behavior.
